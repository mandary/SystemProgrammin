C supports pointers to variables and pointers to code.
Code pointers must point at functions.  Functions have
types.  You declare a function pointer for a function
that takes no arguments and returns nothing like this:

void (*pFunc)();

The function pointer, pFunc, is a pointer.  It has been
reserved 8 bytes of memory.  It can be assigned to.
