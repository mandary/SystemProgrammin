sizeof is a compile time operator that "returns" the number
of bytes of memory allocated for a type.  It takes a single
argument, a type name.  It can also be given an expression,
in which case it gives the number of byes required by 
the type of the result of the expression.  (It does not
evaluate the expression, it evaluates only the type of
the expression.)

sizeof is essential for malloc, which requires you to tell
it how many bytes you want to allocate.

(There's an exception to the rule above.  If sizeof is 
applied to a variable length array, then it is evaluated
at runtime.)
