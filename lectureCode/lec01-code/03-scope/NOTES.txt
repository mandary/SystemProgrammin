The "scope" of a variable's name is the region of the source over
which the use of that name indicates a reference to that variable.

C has two primary kinds of scope, global and local.  Global means
that the name can have meaning everywhere in the program.  Local
means the name has meaning from the point of declaration to the 
end of the most enclosing set of braces containing the declaration.

In our example, main.c, we have two different variables named x.
One has scope that is the procedure main.  The other has scope
that is the block of code in braces within main.
