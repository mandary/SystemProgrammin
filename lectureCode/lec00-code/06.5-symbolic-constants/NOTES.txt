#define is another proprocessor directive.  For 
example,

#define MINUS_ONE -1

That says (to the preprocessor), every time you see
the string "MINUS_ONE" in a line of text you're about
to write to your output, substitute the string "-1" for
it.

#include is most often used to get the effect of symbolic
constants -- giving a name to a value.
