This version typedefs Point and Vector to be pointers to structs.
That is, Points and Vectors act like references, just as in Java.

The big downside of this is that the methods that create new Points/Vectors
must malloc space for them, and that means that the caller must then
remember to free that space (by calling the corresponding delete method).
