This version uses structs to for the data representation
of Point and Vector "objects."  Structs are passed and
returned by value, which means the methods that new objects
can simply create ones on the stack and return them.

On the other hand, sometimes we want call-by-reference semantics,
and in that case the programmer has to remember to pass a pointer.
That isn't very Java-like, so the next version makes a Point 
a pointer to a structure (and similarly for a Vector).  With
that change, when you pass a Point or Vector to a subroutine
the semantics are what you're used to in Java.
